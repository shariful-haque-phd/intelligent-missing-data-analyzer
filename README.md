# Intelligent Missing Data Analyzer

Benchmarks several numeric imputation strategies on a dataset by masking known values, reconstructing them, and comparing reconstruction error.

## Research context

Which missing-value treatments preserve downstream analytical quality under controlled masking?

The repository provides an inspectable implementation of **imputation benchmarking**. It is an exploratory engineering project; broader effectiveness and practical deployment require further study.

## Implemented capabilities

- Imputation benchmarking

## Architecture

The diagram is a simplified view of the supplied implementation. Detailed modules and interface assumptions are in [architecture notes](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Run locally

**Environment:** Python 3.11+ is the documented baseline. Install optional services or hardware drivers when required. Dependencies: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn.

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate       # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the following commands from the repository root:

```bash
python src/analyze_missing.py sample/data.csv --mask-rate 0.15
```

**Input:** `sample/data.csv`

## Results

**Executed locally** with the included input files. This is an implementation check, not an independently validated benchmark.

**Saved outputs**

- The command writes its results to standard output. See the transcript.

The values above come from the bundled fixtures. Model scores, simulated costs, and resource-use estimates should not be interpreted as real-world deployment results.

## Source structure

- [`src/analyze_missing.py`](src/analyze_missing.py)

Documentation is in [`docs/`](docs/). Bundled inputs remain in their original folders. The original project instructions are archived in [`docs/ORIGINAL_README.md`](docs/ORIGINAL_README.md).

## Limits and next research steps

- Results shown here are from local bundled inputs; they are not published research findings or evidence of external deployment.
- Validate domain assumptions and compare against a documented baseline before making performance or reliability claims.
- Extend testing to larger, independently sourced datasets and report reproducibility, failures and relevant ethical risks.
